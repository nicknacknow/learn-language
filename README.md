# learn-language
This program is used to learn any language (e.g. French).
To load a language, you first need to input a link which contains JSON of the word, and the translated version of this word. 
For example: https://pastebin.com/raw/28wtJmh4


Note to self:
perhaps automatically translate inputted words
